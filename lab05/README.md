### First Order System Identification Applied To Temperature Measurement System

We use RTD to measure water temperature after suddenly put devices from cold water to hot or vice versa.

### Collected Data
Measure 6 times

* Temperature Data
`temp = [[20.5, 56], [55.5, 21], [21, 76], [76, 22], [21.5, 68], [68, 22]]`

* Dynamic Data
`lab05log*.txt` from 7 to 12 
(First 6 times have some error due to some programming problems)
`


## Result
`python3 lab05.py`
and create *.jpg
