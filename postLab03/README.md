### Practice Statistical Analysis
1. Estimate 95% confidence intervals for the true mean.

2. Determine whether there is overlap more than 95%, the diameter is considered to have remained unchanged.

3. If the number of samples N is increased from 10 to 100, determine whether outer diameters are the same for the above two batches.

### Data
Data is provided in problem.
Batch 117:
`1.0006 1.0072 0.9941 0.9918 0.9986 0.9991 1.0107 0.9981 1.0011 1.0218`
Batch 384:
`0.9854 1.0056 1.0041 1.0132 0.9902 0.9876 1.0094 0.9815 0.9999 1.0027`
